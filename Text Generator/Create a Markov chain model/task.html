<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>We already mentioned Markov chains<strong> </strong>a few times. A <strong>Markov chain</strong> is a statistical model in which the probability of each event depends on the previous event. It can be described as a set of states and transitions between them. Each transition has a probability that is determined by some kind of statistical data. In this project, a state corresponds to a token, and each transition represents going from one word of a sentence to another. The probability of transitions is calculated from the bigrams we collected in the previous stage. The basic idea of this project is that from a dictionary we can create a model that will consider all the possible transitions from one word to another and choose the most probable one based on the previous word.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is the final step where we will work on creating a Markov chain model. We will use the data prepared in the first two stages and transform it into a model. This model will contain probabilistic information that will tell us what the next word in a chain might be.</p>

<p>We already have a list of all bigrams from the corpus. As we discussed earlier, this can already be used to make some naive predictions. There is a problem, though: right now our data contains a lot of repetition. As we have seen at the first stage, the total number of tokens is almost 10 times greater than the number of unique tokens. This ratio must about the same in the list of bigrams. Some bigrams might be very common, others — relatively rare. At the moment, we have no way of telling which are which.</p>

<p>To resolve this problem, we will make a simplified version of a Markov chain model.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>The data should be reorganized in such a way that every head is repeated only once, and all the possible tails can be directly accessed by querying that head. For example: <em>head</em> — <code class="java">good</code>, <em>tails</em> — <code class="java">night</code>, <code class="java">bye</code>, <code class="java">bye</code>, <code class="java">night</code>, <code class="java">to</code>, <code class="java">to</code>, <code class="java">bye</code>, <code class="java">boy</code>. As you can see, there are still some repetitions among the tails.</li>
	<li>Instead of repeating tails every time they occur, each tail should appear only once and the number of repetitions should be stored as an integer. For example, the previous example should look like this: <em>head</em> — <code class="java">good</code>, <em>tails</em> — <code class="java">night: 2</code>, <code class="java">bye: 3</code>, <code class="java">to: 2</code>, <code class="java">boy: 1</code>.<br>
	You can see that the data is more readable after this transformation!</li>
	<li>Besides creating the model, we should also check that it works correctly. To test it, let's take a string as user input and print all the possible tails and their corresponding counts. If the model does not contain the specified head, ask for another until it is valid. Repeat until the string <code class="java">exit</code> is input.<br>
	<br>
	You should only print the output of the current stage and not the previous one, but like in the previous stage, the name of the file that contains the corpus should be given as user input.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents user input.</p>

<p>The output of the program should look something like this. The number of tabs and spaces does not matter, but newline characters do.</p>
