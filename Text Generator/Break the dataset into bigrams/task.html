<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>To study how texts are structured, we usually have to take into consideration not just individual words but sequences of words and the relationships between them. These sequences might consist of any number of words, but usually, the number is limited to only two or three.</p>

<p>A sequence of any number of adjacent tokens is called an <strong>n-gram</strong>, where <em>n</em> is the number of tokens. A sequence of two adjacent tokens is called a <strong>bigram</strong>. Not surprisingly, a sequence of three adjacent tokens is a <strong>trigram</strong>. For now, we will stick to bigrams only.</p>

<p>When referring to bigrams in this project, we divide them into two parts: <strong>head</strong> and <strong>tail</strong>. In our case, the first token of the bigram is the head and the second token is the tail. For example, in the bigram <code class="java">good night</code>, <code class="java">good</code> is the head and <code class="java">night</code> is the tail.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>After the training data is acquired and preprocessed, it has to be transformed into a Markov chain model. The first step is to map the connections between tokens in the corpus. For this, we are going to use bigrams.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Transform the corpus into a collection of bigrams. The results should contain all the possible bigrams from the corpus, which means that:<br>
	— Every token from the corpus should be a head of a bigram with the exception of the last token which cannot become a head since nothing follows it;<br>
	— Every token from the corpus should be a tail of a bigram with the exception of the first token which cannot possibly be the tail of a bigram because nothing precedes it.</li>
	<li>Output the number of all bigrams in the corpus.</li>
	<li>Take an integer as user input and print the bigrams with the corresponding index. Repeat this process until the string <code class="java">exit</code> is input. Also, make sure that the input is actually an integer that falls in the range of the collection of bigrams. If that is not the case, print an error message and request a new input. Error messages should contain the types of errors (<code class="java">Type Error</code>, <code class="java">Index Error</code>, etc.). Each bigram should have the format <code class="java">Head: [head] Tail: [tail]</code> and should be printed in a new line.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should only print the output of the current stage and not the previous one, but like in the previous stage, the name of the file that contains the corpus should be given as user input.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents user input.</p>

<p>This is what the expected input should look like. Tabs and spaces do not matter during testing, but newlines do. </p>
