<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>In <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>), most work starts by obtaining and preprocessing a text <strong>corpus</strong>. The word "corpus" might seem scary at first, but it actually simply refers to a collection of textual data. Its contents might be related thematically or based on some particular linguistic phenomena. Corpora usually have some kind of <strong>annotation</strong> that contains additional information about the text.</p>

<p>For most linguistic tasks, the corpus has to be processed before we can access all the important information. One of the most basic operations is tokenization. In NLP, an individual text element (in most cases, a single word) is called a <strong>token</strong>, and the process of breaking the corpus into tokens is called <strong>tokenization</strong>. </p>

<p>In our case, the corpus is stored as a <em>.txt</em> file with UTF-8 encoding. When reading a text file in Python, you can specify the encoding of the document like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">f = open("corpus.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")</code></pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this project, we will use a corpus that contains the entire script of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. As the corpus will be used to "train" a probabilistic model that will predict the next word in a chain of words, the generated text will resemble the style and vocabulary of the source material. The naturalness of the generated test depends on the data. The bigger the corpus, the better the results. The corpus that we will be using in this project consists of around 300,000 tokens. That is not perfect, but it's good enough to get interesting results.</p>

<p>After you complete this project, you can use any corpus you want to experiment with different styles and lengths — you might even compile your own corpus and go with that. But for now, let's just stick to the corpus provided for this project. By the way, don't hesitate to test your program on your own with our <a target="_blank" href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/385260/corpus.txt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">corpus</a>. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In order to prepare the corpus for use in this project, we need to take the following important steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open and read the corpus from the provided file <code class="language-python">corpus.txt</code>. The filename should be specified as user input. Note that the file is written in UTF-8 encoding, and the file should be in the same folder as your Python script.</li>
	<li>Break the corpus into individual words. To create a Markov model, we use the simplest form of tokenization: tokens are separated by whitespace characters such as spaces, tabulation, and newline characters. Punctuation marks should be left untouched since later on, they will play an important role in signaling where a sentence should end.</li>
	<li>Acquire and print the following information about the corpus under the section of the output called <code class="language-python">Corpus statistics</code>:<br>
	   — the number of all tokens;<br>
	   — the number of all unique tokens, that is, the number of tokens without repetition.<br>
	Each of the above should be in a new line.</li>
	<li>Take an integer as user input and print the token with the corresponding index. Repeat this process until the string <code class="language-python">exit</code> is input. Also, make sure that the input index is actually an integer that falls in the range of the corpus. If that is not the case, print an error message and request a new input. Error messages should contain the types of errors (<code class="language-python">Type Error</code>, <code class="language-python">Index Error</code>, etc.).<br>
	Each token should be printed in a new line.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-python">&gt; </code>) represents user input.</p>

<p>The output of the program should look like this. Note that this is just an example: you might get completely different results.</p>
